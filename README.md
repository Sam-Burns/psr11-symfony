This is not a PSR-11 compliant service container.  It does not, for example, provide any functionality to do with delegate containers.

It does implement what is likely to become the PSR-11 interface for a service container.  It can therefore be used as a temporary stop-gap until PSR-11 is voted on, and 'proper' implementations become available.
